rpm -U gamin... gamin-devel-...
will replace fam and fam-devel with the new code.
It's good enough for gnome-vfs and nautilus, but some of the entry points
of the FAM library do not work exactly the same way or are missing, plus
the documentation is inexistent, so there is some work left to do but
it can be tested right now.
The server are autostarted by the library (gam_server) and auto-exits
once there isn't any client connected for a while, so contrary to fam
it is not a daemon anymore. It works under the uid of the user, using
a socked not accessible from the filesystem. The socket name can be
modified by setting the FAM_CLIENT_ID environment variable to a
unique string. There is another environment variable GAM_DEBUG allowing
to debug what's going on the server and the client.
The server can also be launched manually
  gam_server [--notimeout] [FAM_CLIENT_ID]
