 - on the client handle numbers provided by the caller.
 - merge GAMIN_EVENT_ with FAMEvents ?
 - check both ways of identification, not just server checking client.
 - cleanup deps w.r.t. libmarmot
 - try to use getlogin and $USER to get the user name
 - remove threading, gam_poll_init_full(), use timers instead
   of running a loop with usleep in a thread.
 - code 'cb' processing cleanup
 - doc extraction and reformatting of comments in gtk-doc style
 - add a flag for server to not exit on idle
                                                                                
Regression tests:
  - try all the file length on the client till error.
  - try the fragmented/multirequests tests on the client side

Done:
  - path flexibility for the remote server in gam_fork.c
  - test for availability of setsid(), usleep()
  - code and file cleanup, indenting
  - removed old common dependancy
  - autostart/stop of the server side
